/* 
When to use return by address:
When returning dynamically allocated memory and you canâ€™t use a type that handles allocations for you
When returning function arguments that were passed by address

When not to use return by address:
When returning variables that were declared inside the function or parameters that were passed by value (use return by value)
When returning a large struct or class that was passed by reference (use return by reference)
